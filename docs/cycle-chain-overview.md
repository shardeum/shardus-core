# Node List / Cycle Chain Overview

In order to implement core network mechanisms, a Shardus network needs:

- Every node to keep a list of every other node in the network. (**node list**)
- A way for nodes to suggest changes to the node list. (**updates**)
- A way for nodes to agree upon and apply changes to their node lists at the
  same time. (**cycles**)
- A history of all the changes that were made to the node list.
  (**cycle chain**)

Every node keeps a copy of the **node list**, which has the information and
status of every node in the network.

Nodes can suggest changes to the node list with signed messages, called
**updates**, which are passed around to every node in the network.

Nodes gather all the updates they see in a certain amount of time and put the
changes described by the updates into structures called **cycles**. Once the
time to gather updates has passed, nodes compare their cycles to make sure they
have the same changes. After applying the changes to their node lists, the nodes
will start gathering updates for the next cycle. Cycles are created on a regular
interval from the start of the network, for as long as the network runs.

The **cycle chain** is the ordered list of all the cycles created by the
network, going back to the first cycle it created.

To join a Shardus network, a node must sync up with the networks node list and
cycle chain. Once it is synced, it will be able to suggest node list
updates and participate in creating cycles.

## Creating Cycles

Cycles are created on a regular interval and contain the following data:

```typescript
interface Cycle {
  start: number; // cycle start time (epoch)
  duration: number; // cycle duration (ms)
  counter: number; // cycle index number (starting from 0)
  previous: string; // hash of the previous cycle
  joined: []; // array of collected join requests
  removed: []; //
  lost: [];
  apoptosized: [];
  returned: [];
  activated: [];
  certificate: {};
  expired: number;
  desired: number;
}
```

The time to create one cycle can be divided into four quarters, each initiated
by a different function.

## Network-level Processes

These processes update the node list / cycle chain for every node in the network.

### Joining

### Activation

### Expiration

### Auto-scaling

### Apoptosis

### Lost Node detection

## Node-level processes

These processes are used by individual nodes to keep their own copies of the
node list / cycle chain in sync with the rest of the network.

### Syncing

### Repairing

### Re-syncing
